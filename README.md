# viajes-bohemios

I'm doing the [Project: Landing page](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page) of TOP ([The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)) and choosed for it to show the trip I'm doing with my husband. Since we are both spanish speakers, I will use that language in the page.

This project is the final lesson before the JavaScript section in the foundations course in TOP. It will require to put to practice the HTML and CSS learnt so far. 

There is a design already set for me to follow that you can see [here](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/main/foundations/html_css/project/odin-project.png).

## about what inspired the page

The _trip_ I mentioned earlier is the short way we found to refer to the fact that we actually moved countries, crossing the ocean to do so.

We are starting over, and while we get settle, we are traveling around our new country, trying to get to know our new environment. Thus referring to this whole experience as simple "the trip". 

We are taking photos, keeping in touch with our friends and family back home, and it would be nice if we could show them what we were up to last through a website.

So, this is what my project will be about, hope you like it!

### about the images used in this project

The images corresponding to the guidalines are provided and copyrighted by The Odin Project, credit is to them.

The images shown on the landing page were photos taken by either my husband or me and thus own by us. If you want to use them please ask me first.

## new update

I opened the project the same afternoon I pushed the final changes and made a copy because I wanted to write the style from scratch, for practice. 

The first time around I was excited to make my first landing page and that lead me to mistakes that could have been easily avoided. 

This time around, feeling more calm and not so eager, I feel the style ended up being much better. I had to modify the index too to accomplish some of the results I was aiming to get. Unfortunately, because I was working on a copy, I made no commits.

Still, the end result feels worth sharing, so here it is: [viajes-bohemios](https://nkrasno.github.io/viajes-bohemios/).
