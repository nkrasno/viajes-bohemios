# viajes-bohemios

I'm doing the [Project: Landing page](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page) of TOP ([The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)) and choosed for it to show the trip I'm doing with my husband. Since we are both spanish speakers, I will use that language in the page.

This project is the final lesson before the JavaScript section in the foundations course in TOP. It will require to put to practice the HTML and CSS learnt so far. 

There is a design already set for me to follow that you can see [here](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/main/foundations/html_css/project/odin-project.png).

## about what inspired the page

The _trip_ I mentioned earlier is the short way we found to refer to the fact that we actually moved countries, crossing the ocean to do so.

We are starting over, and while we get settle, we are traveling around our new country, trying to get to know our new environment. Thus referring to this whole experience as simple "the trip". 

We are taking photos, keeping in touch with our friends and family back home, and it would be nice if we could show them what we were up to last through a website.

So, this is what my project will be about, hope you like it!
