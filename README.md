# viajes-bohemios

I'm doing the [Project: Landing page](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page) of TOP ([The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)) and choosed for it to show the trip I'm doing with my husband and since we are both spanish speakers, from this point forward I will use that language.

This project is the final lesson before the JavaScript section in the foundations course in TOP and will require to put to practice the HTML and CSS learnt so far.
